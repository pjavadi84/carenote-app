# Kinroster

AI-powered documentation tool for small elder-care providers (6-20 bed residential care homes).

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)
- Claude API (Sonnet 4.6 for structuring, Haiku 4.5 for classification)
- OpenAI Whisper API (voice transcription)
- Resend (email), Stripe (billing), Vercel (hosting)
- Package manager: pnpm

## Key Architecture
- All data is org-scoped via Supabase RLS. Every query filters by organization_id.
- Two user roles: admin (full access) and caregiver (limited access).
- Claude prompts are in `src/lib/prompts/`. Each prompt has a system template and user template.
- Voice: MediaRecorder -> Whisper API -> transcript. Audio is NEVER stored.
- Notes store both `raw_input` (source of truth) and `structured_output` (Claude-generated).
- The `is_structured` flag on notes enables retry for failed Claude calls.

## Commands
- `pnpm dev` — start dev server
- `pnpm build` — production build
- `pnpm lint` — run ESLint

## Important Rules
- PHI must never be logged or stored outside the encrypted database.
- Claude is a scribe, never a clinician. Never diagnose or recommend treatment.
- Always preserve the caregiver's factual observations exactly.
- RLS must be enabled on every table with user data.

## Spec Documents
Docs are organised under `docs/` by category. See `docs/README.md` for the full index. Key references:
- PRD: `docs/product/product-requirements.md` (features F1-F10)
- User flows: `docs/product/user-flows.md`
- Architecture: `docs/engineering/architecture.md`
- Data Model: `docs/engineering/data-model.md`
- Entity model + auth: `docs/engineering/entity-model-and-auth.md`
- Prompts: `docs/engineering/prompt-engineering.md`
- Build Plan: `docs/engineering/build-plan.md`
- Compliance overview: `docs/compliance/compliance-and-security.md`
- Compliance action tracker + gaps: `docs/compliance/compliance-action-tracker.md`, `docs/compliance/compliance-gaps.md`

## Implementation Roadmap
- **HIPAA compliance roadmap:** `docs/compliance/hipaa-roadmap.md` — 10-phase plan to make the app ready for real PHI. Phase 1 (clinician directory + secure sharing) is shipped. Read this before starting any phase, and before changing migrations, RLS, prompts, or sharing flows.

## Prompt versioning
Canonical specs for every LLM prompt live in `prompts/` at the repo root. Each `.md` file has YAML frontmatter (id, version, prior_version, runtime, model, languages, variables) and is the source of truth for the prompt body. Runtime files in `src/lib/prompts/*.ts` reference the spec; the Vapi assistant is paste-synced from `prompts/vapi-intake-assistant.md`. See `prompts/README.md` for the convention and `prompts/CHANGELOG.md` for cross-prompt release history.
