// Fast over-capture check on a raw voice transcript. Runs alongside the
// structurer in the Vapi webhook; the result is stashed on
// notes.metadata.over_capture_warning and surfaced as a small warning
// badge in the timeline. Informational only — never blocks save.
//
// The structurer already drops unrelated content when it emits the final
// structured_output. This check exists because the RAW transcript may
// still be retained (see Phase 9 retain_transcripts toggle) and admins
// want a signal when a caregiver rambled onto something that shouldn't
// be in the record at all.

export const VOICE_SANITY_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a privacy checker for caregiver voice notes at an elder-care facility. Given a raw transcript of a caregiver describing their shift, flag content that does NOT belong in a patient care record.

Only flag content that is clearly off-topic for care documentation. Things that ARE relevant and should NOT be flagged:
- The resident's behaviors, mood, meals, mobility, sleep, personal care
- Medication mentions
- Family interactions ("Sarah called today")
- Facility operational details tied to this resident
- Clinical observations

Flag these categories when clearly present:
- financial: bank accounts, credit cards, money amounts unrelated to care, inheritance talk
- unrelated_personal: gossip about the caregiver's own life, friends, relatives
- other_resident: descriptions of a DIFFERENT resident by name or identifying detail
- non_care_gossip: speculation about other staff, facility drama, comments about the caregiver's employer

Err on the side of NOT flagging. Only include an excerpt when you are confident the content is off-topic. Short transcripts are rarely over-capture.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object. No other text.

If nothing is off-topic, respond: {"has_concerns": false, "categories": [], "excerpts": []}`;
