## Flow 2: Caregiver Enters a Shift Note

**Actor:** Caregiver
**Trigger:** During or at end of shift, caregiver needs to document an observation

```
1. Caregiver opens Kinroster on phone browser (bookmarked / PWA)
   - Already logged in (30-day session persistence)
   - Lands on "Today" view showing residents with today's activity

2. Taps resident name (e.g., "Dorothy M.")
   → Navigates to resident detail page
   → Shows recent notes (last 48 hours)

3. Taps "+ Add Note" button (floating action button, bottom right)

4. NOTE INPUT SCREEN:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Resident: Dorothy M.            │
   │                                 │
   │ Note Type: [Shift Note ▼]      │
   │   Options: Shift Note /         │
   │            Incident /           │
   │            Observation          │
   │                                 │
   │ ┌─────────────────────────────┐ │
   │ │                             │ │
   │ │ Type your observation...    │ │
   │ │                             │ │
   │ │                             │ │
   │ │                             │ │
   │ └─────────────────────────────┘ │
   │                                 │
   │        [Save Note]              │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘

5. Caregiver types raw note:
   "dorothy was agitated this morning, didnt want breakfast.
    calmed down after we went outside for a walk.
    ate lunch fine. daughter called, told her mom is doing ok"

6. Taps "Save Note"

7. PROCESSING STATE:
   - Button changes to spinner with "Structuring note..."
   - Raw input + resident context + system prompt → Claude API
   - Target: < 3 seconds

8. REVIEW SCREEN:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ✓ Note Structured               │

   │ Shift Note — Dorothy M.         │
   │ Apr 3, 2026 · 11:45 AM          │
   │ James R. (Day Shift)            │
   │                                 │
   │ Mood & Behavior: Dorothy was    │
   │ agitated this morning and       │
   │ initially refused breakfast.    │
   │ She calmed down after an        │
   │ outdoor walk with staff.        │
   │                                 │
   │ Nutrition: Refused breakfast.   │
   │ Ate lunch without difficulty.   │
   │                                 │
   │ Family Contact: Dorothy's       │
   │ daughter called. Staff informed │
   │ her that Dorothy is doing well. │
   │                                 │
   │ Follow-up: Monitor morning      │
   │ appetite; note if breakfast     │
   │ refusal continues.             │
   │                                 │
   │ ── Raw Input ──────── [expand] │
   │                                 │
   │   [Edit]  [Save]  [Discard]    │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘

9a. If caregiver taps "Save":
    → Note saved (raw + structured)
    → Returns to resident timeline
    → Success toast: "Note saved"

9b. If caregiver taps "Edit":
    → Structured text becomes editable
    → Caregiver modifies text
    → Taps "Save" → saved with is_edited = true

9c. If caregiver taps "Discard":
    → Confirmation dialog: "Discard this note?"
    → If confirmed, note is not saved
    → Returns to resident page
```

**Edge cases:**
- **Claude API timeout:** Save raw note without structuring. Show message: "Note saved. We'll structure it shortly." Queue for background processing.
- **Empty input:** Prevent submission. Show validation: "Please enter an observation."
- **Very long input (>2,000 chars):** Show character counter. Prevent submission over limit.
- **Non-English input:** Claude handles multilingual input natively. Structured output is in English.

---

## Flow 2b: Caregiver Enters a Shift Note via Voice

**Actor:** Caregiver
**Trigger:** During or at end of shift, caregiver prefers to speak rather than type

```
1. Caregiver opens Kinroster on phone, navigates to resident (same as Flow 2
   steps 1–4)

2. On the note input screen, caregiver taps and holds the microphone button
   (located below the text area)

3. A recording indicator appears — caregiver speaks their observation naturally:
   "Dorothy was agitated this morning, didn't want breakfast. Calmed down after
   we went outside for a walk. Ate lunch fine. Around 10am she slipped getting
   out of the wheelchair, I caught her. No injuries, she said she was fine.
   Daughter called around 11."

4. Caregiver releases the button

5. PROCESSING STATE: "Transcribing..." indicator shown (target < 2 seconds)

6. Transcript populates the raw input text area exactly as typed text would

7. Caregiver reviews the transcript, makes any corrections (e.g. names
   mis-transcribed)

8. Caregiver taps "Save Note" — from this point the flow is identical to
   Flow 2 steps 6 onwards (Claude structuring, incident detection, review screen)
```

**Edge cases:**
- **Background noise causes mis-transcription:** Caregiver edits text before saving; the edit is their responsibility and opportunity to correct before Claude sees it.
- **Resident name transcribed incorrectly (e.g. "Dora fee" for "Dorothy"):** Caregiver corrects in the text area before saving.
- **Network failure during transcription:** Show error "Transcription failed — please type your note or try again"; fall back to text input gracefully.
- **Very short audio (< 2 seconds):** Show validation "Recording too short — hold the button while speaking."
- **Non-English speech:** Whisper handles multilingual input natively; transcript may be in the caregiver's language; Claude structures and outputs in English as normal.

**Note:** Audio is never stored. Only the transcript (as raw_input) is saved to the database. This is both a privacy protection and a storage simplification.

---

## Flow 3: Incident Detection and Report

**Actor:** Caregiver → Admin
**Trigger:** Caregiver enters a note that describes a potential incident

```
1. Caregiver enters note for Mr. Ramirez:
   "mr ramirez slipped getting out of bed around 9pm.
    he grabbed the bedrail and didnt fall. checked him over,
    no injuries, he said hes fine. put his non-slip socks on
    and made sure the floor mat was in place."

2. Taps "Save Note"

3. Claude processes the note:
   - Classification: POSSIBLE_INCIDENT (near-fall)
   - Structured shift note generated as usual
   - Incident flag triggered

4. REVIEW SCREEN (with incident prompt):
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ✓ Note Structured               │
   │                                 │
   │ ⚠ POSSIBLE INCIDENT DETECTED   │
   │ This note describes a near-fall.│
   │ Would you like to create a      │
   │ formal incident report?         │

   │ ─────────────────               │
   │ [structured shift note here]    │
   │                                 │
   │   [Edit]  [Save]  [Discard]    │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘

5a. If caregiver taps "No":
    → Note saved normally with flagged_as_incident = false

## Flow 6: Caregiver Invitation

**Actor:** Admin
**Trigger:** Admin wants to add a new caregiver to the facility

```
1. Admin goes to Settings → Team
2. Taps "Invite Caregiver"
3. Enters caregiver's email address
4. System sends invitation email:
   "Maria at Sunrise Care Home has invited you to join Kinroster.
    Click here to create your account."

   - Enters full name and password
   - Account created with caregiver role, linked to the organization
6. Caregiver is redirected to the "Today" view

```

---

## Flow 7: Shift Handoff (Passive)

**Actor:** Incoming caregiver
**Trigger:** Caregiver starts their shift and wants to know what happened

```

2. Lands on "Today" view
3. Sees notes from the previous shift for each resident
4. Taps any resident to see their recent timeline

Note: This is a passive flow. There is no explicit "handoff"
feature. The value comes from the structured notes being
available and readable. The shift log IS the handoff.
